### Lecture 39 - Reducer
 - Reducer return a piece of state
 - Two steps:
  Step 1: Create reducer
  Step 2: Wire reduces into our application (reducers/index.js)

  ```javascript
  //application state
    {
      books: [{title: "book 1"}, {title: "book 2"}, {title: "book 3"}],
      activeBook: {title: "book 1"}
    }
  ```

### Lecture 40 - connect redux to react
  - use react-redux lib
  Steps:
    - promote one of components to Container component. Container component has a direct connection to the state managed by redux

### Lecture 41 - Container component
  > Container component is just a component that has direct access to the state that's produced by redux

  - @me: Container component needs to receive piece of state from redux
  - Only the most parent component that uses a particular piece of state needs to be connected to redux


### 42 - implement Container class
  - Use connect function from react-redux lib
  ```javascript
  //book-list.js
  import { connect } from 'react-redux';
  ```
  **important notes**:
    - when using connect(), whenever the state changes, the component, container is auto re-render with the new list of books
    - Whenever state changes, the object in state function will be assigned as props in component

### 43 - Review container and reducer
  - redux serves to construct applicate state and react provides the views to display
  - should use react-redux lib to connect this two standalone "redux" and "react"
  - application state is generated by reducer function
  - for reducers, add BooksReducer by using combineReducers from redux

### 44 - Action and Action Creators

### 45 - bindActionCreators
  - bindActionCreators is function make sure action that is generated by action creator ends up following through all the different reducers
